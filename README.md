# Jet Identification Deep Neural Network (JIDENN) 

## Introduction 
This project aims to classify whether a jet came from a quark or gluon. 
Initialy we try to match the results achvieved with BDT using high level variables (derived). 
To do this we implemented few NN models and also BDT to compare the results. 

Afterwards we plan to utilize [transformer architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) and information about the jet constituents to **exceed** the BDT results.
